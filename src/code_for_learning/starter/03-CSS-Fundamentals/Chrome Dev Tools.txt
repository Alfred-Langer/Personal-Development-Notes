Chrome Dev Tools Things you probably didn't know: 

The CSS styles/rules that are
listed in the Styles tab of ChromeDevTools shows you the order/hierachy of the
rules. The rules at the top will take precedent and override any other rules
below it. You'll often see that rules that are overridden will be crossed out.

User Agent Stylesheet refers to the defaults CSS styling of elements. AKA if you
haven't styled an element in your own CSS sheets, the UserAgentStylesheet will
style them with default values. This is why <h1> elements are always bold even
without CSS stylings. This is also why <p> and <div>elements have a display attribute
of block by default.

You can add and modify the CSS rules listed in the Styles Tab for a particular element.
You can also modify the state of certain elements for pseudo classes. So for example, you
can see what the stylings of an <a> element would be if the element is being hovered
or clicked. 

This is done by clicking on an element. In the Styles tab you should see a button
labelled :hov. When you click on that you should then see various states that you
can force the element to be in see how it's styled during that state.




CSS THEORY #1: Conflicts between selectors

There is a priority in rules

Inline styling
Internal styling
External styling


The more specific the selector is the more precedent it has

Ids are more specific than classes
Classes are more specific than element selectors
If using a group selector, the less elements the more specific

If two selectors have the same precedent, then it's the last written rule that gets
applied

!important will always take the most priority regardless of where it's placed



5 !important
4 Inline styling
3 Id selectors
2 Class/Pseudo selectors
1 Element selectors

Last Style loaded will be used if two styles have the same priority.
