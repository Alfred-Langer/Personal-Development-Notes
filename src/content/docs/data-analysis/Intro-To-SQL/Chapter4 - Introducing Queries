# Introduction to SQL Queries

SQL is used to answer questions both within and across relational database tables. For example:

- Which books did a patron check out in 2022?
- Are salaries comparable across departments?
- Which products had the highest sales last week?
- How did website traffic change when a feature was introduced?

SQL is particularly powerful for analyzing large datasets and uncovering trends.

# SQL Keywords

**Keywords** are reserved words that indicate what operation we want our code to perform. The two most common keywords are SELECT and FROM.

## SELECT

The SELECT keyword indicates which fields should be selected from a table.

**Selecting one field:**

```sql
SELECT name FROM patrons;
```

**Selecting multiple fields:**
List field names separated by commas in the order you want them to appear in the result set.

```sql
SELECT card_num, name FROM patrons;
```

**Selecting all fields:**
Use an asterisk (\*), also known as a wildcard character, to select all fields.

```sql
SELECT * FROM patrons;
```

## FROM

The FROM keyword indicates which table the fields are located in.

## SQL Query Structure

A complete SQL query follows this structure:

```sql
SELECT field_name(s)
FROM table_name;
```

**Important conventions:**

- Keywords (SELECT, FROM) are capitalized
- Table and field names are lowercase
- Queries end with a semicolon (;) to indicate the query is complete
- The results of a query are called a **result set**

## Examples

Get first name and age from clients table:

```sql
SELECT first_name, age FROM clients;
```

Get all fields from clients table:

```sql
SELECT * FROM clients;
```
