# Records and Fields

In databases, rows are often referred to as **records** and columns as **fields**.

- **Records**: Each record contains the data for an individual observation (one row = one patron, one book, etc.)
- **Fields**: Each field contains one piece of information for every record in a table (the name field contains all patrons' names)

# Table Names

Table names should be clear and refer to the data contained within them. Examples include: students, cars, products, vendors, library_patrons. Table names should be lowercase and use snake_case formatting.

# Field Naming

Field names should be:

- Lowercase with snake_case (card_num, teacher_id, serial_number)
- **Singular** rather than plural (name, not names) because each field refers to information for a single record
- Unique within the table - no duplicate field names
- Different from the table name to avoid confusion

Field naming is important because you'll type these names when writing SQL queries.

# Unique Identifiers (Keys)

Tables should include a special field containing a unique identifier for each record, sometimes called a **key**. The key value must be unique for every record - no duplicates allowed.

**Good unique identifiers**: ID numbers (card_num, student_id, employee_id)
**Poor unique identifiers**: Names (multiple people can share the same name)

# Using Multiple Tables to Organize Data

Using several well-organized tables is better than putting everything into one large table. Combining tables creates problems:

- **Duplicate information**: The same data appears in multiple rows
- **Lost uniqueness**: Key fields are no longer unique (e.g., if one patron has multiple checkouts, their card_num appears multiple times)

Keeping data in separate, related tables and connecting them with SQL makes it easier to analyze data and answer questions.
