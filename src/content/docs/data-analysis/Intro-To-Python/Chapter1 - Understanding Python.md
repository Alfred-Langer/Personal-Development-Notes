# What is Python?

Python is a very versatile programming language that can be used to build pretty much any piece of software. 

Key facts about Python:
- Open Source and Free to use
- Easy to build, distribute, and utilize packages through PIP

# What is the Python Shell?

The Python shell is an interactive environment where users are able to execute Python code and see immediate results back.

In this course, we're using **IPython** (Interactive Python), which is an enhanced version of the standard Python shell with additional features. It's part of the broader Jupyter ecosystem.

# Python Scripts

Although the Python shell is a great tool for learning, Python is primarily executed/run through Python scripts. These are just text files with the `.py` extension that contain Python code and can be executed through the terminal of a computer.

# Output in the Shell vs Scripts

As you might have noticed, the Shell will automatically display any outputs from operations or functions that you run. However if you run scripts, that same output won't be displayed. This is because you have to manually tell Python to display the output of an operation to the terminal. This is done with the `print()` function.

**Example:**
```python
print(4 + 5)  # Outputs: 9
```

# Key Takeaways

- **IPython Shell**: Great for experimentation and testing small code snippets
- **Python Scripts (.py files)**: Used for writing structured, reusable code
- **Remember**: Always use `print()` in scripts to see output; the shell displays results automatically
