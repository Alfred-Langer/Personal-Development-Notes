# Variables

Variables are like containers where you can store information/data. You can create a variable simply by giving it a name and assigning a value to it

Ex:
my_variable = 6

Things to note:

- Variable names are case-sensitive. (my_variable is different from my_Variable)
- Variable names SHOULD be lower-case

After the creation of a variable you can then use it's assigned value by utizling the variable's name.

Ex:
my_variable = 6
print(my_variable)

- Here, Python knows that my_variable exists and has the value 6, so it outputs 6 to the terminal via print()

# Modifying Variable's values

You can reassign a variable's value at any time.
