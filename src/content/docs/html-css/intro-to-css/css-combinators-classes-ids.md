## What Are CSS Combinators

CSS combinators are used to describe the relationship between HTML elements. You can use combinators as a way to select elements that have specific relationships
with other elements.

## CSS Combinators

### Descendant Combinator

Targets elements that are nested inside another element, regardless of how deeply nested they are.

**Syntax:**

```css
ancestor descendant {
  /* styles */
}
```

**Example:**

```css
footer p {
  font-size: 14px;
  color: gray;
}

article header p {
  font-style: italic;
}
```

The first rule targets all `<p>` elements inside a `<footer>`.  
The second rule targets all `<p>` elements inside a `<header>` that's inside an `<article>`.

**How it works:**

- Uses a space between selectors
- Targets descendants at ANY level (children, grandchildren, great-grandchildren, etc.)
- The descendant doesn't have to be a direct child

**Example HTML:**

```html
<footer>
  <div>
    <p>This paragraph will be styled</p>
  </div>
  <p>This paragraph will also be styled</p>
</footer>
```

Both paragraphs would be styled by the first CSS rule because they're both descendants of `<footer>`, even though one is nested deeper.

---

### Child Selector (Direct Child Combinator)

Targets elements that are **direct children only** (not grandchildren or deeper descendants).

**Syntax:**

```css
parent > child {
  /* styles */
}
```

**Example:**

```css
ul > li {
  list-style-type: square;
}

article > p {
  margin-bottom: 20px;
}
```

**Difference from Descendant Selector:**

```html
<article>
  <p>This paragraph is styled</p>
  <div>
    <p>This paragraph is NOT styled</p>
  </div>
</article>
```

The selector `article > p` only targets the first `<p>` because it's a direct child of `<article>`. The second `<p>` is a grandchild (child of `<div>`), so it's not selected.

---

### Adjacent Sibling Selector

Targets an element that comes **immediately after** another specific element (they must share the same parent).

**Syntax:**

```css
element1 + element2 {
  /* styles */
}
```

**Example:**

```css
h2 + p {
  font-weight: bold;
  margin-top: 0;
}
```

This targets a `<p>` element that comes **immediately after** an `<h2>`.

**Example HTML:**

```html
<h2>Section Title</h2>
<p>This paragraph is styled (immediately follows h2)</p>
<p>This paragraph is NOT styled (doesn't immediately follow h2)</p>
```

---

### General Sibling Selector

Targets **all** sibling elements that come after a specific element (they must share the same parent).

**Syntax:**

```css
element1 ~ element2 {
  /* styles */
}
```

**Example:**

```css
h2 ~ p {
  color: #666;
}
```

This targets **all** `<p>` elements that come after an `<h2>` (as long as they're siblings).

**Example HTML:**

```html
<h2>Section Title</h2>
<p>This paragraph is styled</p>
<div>Some content</div>
<p>This paragraph is also styled</p>
<p>This paragraph is also styled</p>
```

All three paragraphs are styled because they all come after the `<h2>` as siblings.

**Difference from Adjacent Sibling:**

- Adjacent (`+`): Only the **immediate next** sibling
- General (`~`): **All following** siblings of that type

---

## List Selector (Grouping Selector)

Not a combinator, but it's useful for selecting multiple elements that don't have a targetable relationship.
Applies the same styles to multiple different elements by separating them with commas.

**Syntax:**

```css
selector1,
selector2,
selector3 {
  /* styles */
}
```

**Example:**

```css
h1,
h2,
li,
p {
  font-family: Arial, sans-serif;
  color: #333;
}
```

This applies the same font and color to all `<h1>`, `<h2>`, `<li>`, and `<p>` elements.

**When to use:**

- When multiple different elements should share the same styling
- To reduce code repetition and keep your CSS DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)

---

## Class Selectors

Classes allow you to target one or more elements by assigning them a class name in HTML.

**Syntax:**

```css
.className {
  /* styles */
}
```

**HTML:**

```html
<p class="error">This is an error message.</p>
<p class="success">This is a success message.</p>
<div class="error">Another error here.</div>
```

**CSS:**

```css
.error {
  color: red;
  border: 1px solid red;
  background-color: #ffe6e6;
}

.success {
  color: green;
  border: 1px solid green;
  background-color: #e6ffe6;
}
```

**Key Points:**

- Classes start with a dot (`.`) in CSS
- Multiple elements can share the same class
- An element can have multiple classes: `class="error bold"`
- Classes are reusable and are the most common way to style elements

---

## ID Selectors

IDs allow you to target a single unique element by assigning it an ID in HTML.

**Syntax:**

```css
#idName {
  /* styles */
}
```

**HTML:**

```html
<div id="author">Written by Jane Doe</div>
<aside id="secondary">Additional information here</aside>
```

**CSS:**

```css
#author {
  font-style: italic;
  color: #555;
}

#secondary {
  background-color: #f5f5f5;
  padding: 20px;
}
```

**Key Points:**

- IDs start with a hash/pound sign (`#`) in CSS
- **Each ID should be unique** – only one element per page should have a specific ID
- IDs have higher specificity than classes (covered in later lectures)

---

## Classes vs IDs: Which Should You Use?

### Why Classes Are Preferred

Most developers primarily use **classes** rather than IDs for styling. Here's why:

**Future-Proofing:**

- If you have a single list styled with an ID, and later need to add a second list with the same styling, you'd need to:
  - Create a duplicate CSS rule, or
  - Change the ID to a class and update your HTML

**Example Problem with IDs:**

```css
#product-list {
  border: 1px solid #ddd;
  padding: 20px;
}
```

```html
<ul id="product-list">
  <li>Product 1</li>
  <li>Product 2</li>
</ul>

<!-- Later you want to add another list -->
<ul id="product-list">
  <!-- Invalid! Can't reuse the same ID -->
  <li>Product 3</li>
  <li>Product 4</li>
</ul>
```

**Better Solution with Classes:**

```css
.product-list {
  border: 1px solid #ddd;
  padding: 20px;
}
```

```html
<ul class="product-list">
  <li>Product 1</li>
  <li>Product 2</li>
</ul>

<!-- No problem adding another list -->
<ul class="product-list">
  <li>Product 3</li>
  <li>Product 4</li>
</ul>
```

### When to Use IDs

**Valid Uses for IDs:**

- Anchor links (jumping to sections): `<a href="#about">About</a>`
- JavaScript DOM manipulation: `document.getElementById('submit-button')`
- Form label associations: `<label for="email">Email:</label>`
- Truly unique page elements: navigation bars, main content areas

**Recommendation:** Use classes for styling, reserve IDs for functionality and unique page landmarks.

---

## Combining Classes and IDs with Other Selectors

You can combine class and ID selectors with element selectors for more specific targeting.

**Examples:**

```css
/* Target paragraphs with the "error" class */
p.error {
  font-weight: bold;
}

/* Target list items inside an element with ID "main-nav" */
#main-nav li {
  display: inline-block;
}

/* Target links with class "button" inside a footer */
footer a.button {
  padding: 10px 20px;
  background-color: blue;
}
```

**Note:** No space between element and class/ID means the class/ID must be on that specific element. A space means descendant relationship.

## Quick Reference Table

| Selector Type    | Syntax                 | Example     | Targets                                       |
| ---------------- | ---------------------- | ----------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| Element          | `element`              | `p`         | All `<p>` elements                            |
| Class            | `.className`           | `.error`    | All elements with `class="error"`             |
| ID               | `#idName`              | `#header`   | The element with `id="header"`                |
| List (Group)     | `selector1, selector2` | `h1, h2, p` | All `<h1>`, `<h2>`, and `<p>` elements        |
| Descendant       | `ancestor descendant`  | `div p`     | All `<p>` inside `<div>` (any level)          |
| Child            | `parent > child`       | `ul > li`   | All `<li>` that are direct children of `<ul>` |
| Adjacent Sibling | `element1 + element2`  | `h2 + p`    | `<p>` immediately after `<h2>`                |
| General Sibling  | `element1 ~ element2`  | `h2 ~ p`    | All `<p>` after `<h2>` (same parent)          |

## Selector Specificity Preview

When multiple CSS rules target the same element, conflicts can occur. CSS has a specificity system to determine which rule wins:

**Specificity Hierarchy (from lowest to highest):**

1. Element selectors (`p`, `div`, `h1`)
2. Class selectors (`.error`, `.success`)
3. ID selectors (`#header`, `#main`)
4. Inline styles (`style="color: red;"`)

**Example:**

```css
p {
  color: blue; /* Specificity: 1 */
}

.error {
  color: red; /* Specificity: 10 */
}

#main {
  color: green; /* Specificity: 100 */
}
```

If a paragraph has both a class and an ID, the ID rule wins because it has higher specificity.

> Note: Specificity and the cascade will be covered in more detail in a later lecture.

## Best Practices

1. **Favor classes over IDs** for styling
2. **Keep selectors simple** – avoid overly specific selectors like `div#container > ul.nav > li > a`
3. **Use semantic class names** – `.error-message` is better than `.red-text`
4. **Group common styles** – use list selectors to reduce repetition
5. **Be mindful of specificity** – more specific selectors can make CSS harder to override later

---

## Summary

- **Element selectors** target all elements of a type
- **List selectors** apply styles to multiple different elements
- **Descendant selectors** target nested elements at any level
- **Child selectors** target only direct children
- **Sibling selectors** target elements that come after others
- **Classes** are reusable and should be your primary styling tool
- **IDs** should be unique and reserved for specific purposes
- Combining selectors gives you precise control over your styling
